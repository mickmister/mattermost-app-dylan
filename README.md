# Dylan App

This App allows you to install a plugin from a given PR URL. The App installs the given plugin on the current server. If the plugin is already installed, it is overwritten by the new downloaded version.

Use the `/dylan` command with the `pr` argument to install from a PR URL. If the argument is omitted, a modal is shown to select from a plugin repo, and then a PR from the chosen repo.
